# Hades (Anticheat Project)

**OVERVIEW**

Hades is an advanced anticheat with many checks designed to patch various cheats/hacks. The goal of this project is to provide a free anticheat solution for servers that automatically punishes any player that uses any form of cheat. This project will always be open-sourced and free, so you can use this anticheat on your server and modify it to fit your server needs. None of the code is used from other online sources or people without crediting the source. Since this project is rather new, expect bugs & many things to be labeled untested.

**SUPPORT**

Please join the official Hades discord server (https://discord.me/hadesanticheat) for faster support! It is almost guaranteed that one of the Hades developers will be on!

**FEATURES**

Hades is 100% async, and utilizes multiple threads. This allows Hades to run checks against hundreds of users with very little lag on the main server thread. This means that Hades should not cause your server to lag and should not drop TPS.

Hades detections are advanced and constantly tested and updated. All of our checks go through extensive testing before being released in an official build. We want to make sure that your legit playerbase is not affected while still actively punishing cheaters.

Hades does not effect gameplay while checking for cheats or after cheat is detected so that your legit players games are not interrupted by Hades.

Hades also doesn't require any dependencies, and is extremely lightweight. This makes it easier for us to develop and easier for you to download and use in your server.

**COMMANDS & PERMISSIONS**

The commands are being re-added in the recode! We will post them here soon! Sorry for the inconvenience!
